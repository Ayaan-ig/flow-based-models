# Flow-Based Models                                                           
This project is a Python-based collection of implementations for Flow-Based Generative Models, including NICE, Real NVP, and Glow. It is designed to help learners experiment with these powerful models and understand their underlying mechanisms. It is also suggested to go through Variational Inference

## Included Models:
### 1.NICE (Non-linear Independent Components Estimation)

### 2.Real NVP (Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving)

### 3.Glow (Generative Flow with Invertible 1x1 Convolutions)
