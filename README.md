Flow-Based Models
This project is a Python-based collection of implementations for Flow-Based Generative Models, including NICE, Real NVP, and Glow. It is designed to help learners experiment with these powerful models and understand their underlying mechanisms. The repository also contains code related to variational inference, often used alongside or in comparison with flow-based methods.

ðŸ“¦ Included Models
NICE (Non-linear Independent Components Estimation)

Real NVP (Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving)

Glow (Generative Flow with Invertible 1x1 Convolutions)
